# Python Interpreter
This repository is a python interpreter which is implemented by python itself.
## implemented features
- built-in types includes None, numbers(integer, float, bool), string, list, tuple, dict, set
- basic operators(mathmatical operators, relational operators, logical operators)
- built-in functions(just some common used functions such as len, zip etc)
- high-order functions
- OOP
- Module system
## needs to be done
- exceptions
- more tests to finds bugs

## the end

since this project is just used to learn how to write a interpreter for mainstream programming
languages, my goal is not to write a complete Interpreter, just the core part of python.
