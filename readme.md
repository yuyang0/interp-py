# Python Interpreter
This repository is a python interpreter which is implemented by python itself.
## implemented features
- Built-in types includes None, numbers(integer, float, bool), string, list, tuple, dict, set
- Basic operators(mathmatical operators, relational operators, logical operators)
- Built-in functions(just some common used functions such as len, zip etc)
- High-order function
- OOP
- Module system

## needs to be done

- exception
- decorator
- with statement
- more tests to find bugs

## the end

This project is just used to learn how to write a interpreter for mainstream programming
languages, my goal is not to write a complete python interpreter, so I just implemented
the core part of python.
